<H1 CLASS="western">Sampler items</H1>
<P>Sampler items allow you to play sound files. You can adjust a
number of parameters. Only files in .wav or .ogg format can be used.
If you need to convert sound files, for example from .mp3 format, you
can use Audacity &lt;<A HREF="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">http://audacity.sourceforge.net/</A>&gt;,
an excellent open-source sound editor.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>Volume</B> between 0 and 100%</P>
	<LI><P><B>Pan</B> turns the right (negative values) or left
	(positive values) channel down. Setting pan to -20 or 20 completely
	mutes the right or left channel, respectively.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Pitch</B> indicates the speed at which the sample is
	played. Values higher than 100% indicate a speed-up, values lower
	than 100% indicate a slowing down.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Stop after</B> indicates how long the sample should be
	played. For example, a value of 100ms means that the sample will be
	stopped after 100ms, regardless of how long the sample is. A value
	of 0ms means playing the full sample.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Fade in</B> indicates the fade in time for the sample.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Duration</B> indicates the duration of the sampler item,
	before the next item is presented. This doesn't need to match the
	length of the sample. For example, the duration of the sampler may
	be set to 0ms, to advance directly to the next item (e.g., a
	sketchpad), while the sample continues playing. In addition to a
	numeric value, you can set duration to 'keypress', to wait for a
	keyboard press, 'mouseclick', to wait for a mouse click, or 'sound',
	to wait until the sampler has finished playing.</P>
</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western">Sampling rate</H2>
<P>Sound files are always played back at the sampling rate that is
used by the OpenSesame sampler back-end. If your sample appears to be
sped up or slowed down, you can adjust the sampling rate of your
sound file in a sound editor or change the sampling rate used by the
OpenSesame sampler back-end (under 'Show back-end settings and info'
in the General tab).</P>
