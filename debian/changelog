opensesame (0.23+git1-g0212357-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Package from subsequent Git commit as upstream removed
    pre-generated PDFs after the 0.23 release.
  * Added python-pygame, python-numpy and python-tk as a build-dependency,
    because they are now required by setup.py.
